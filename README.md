# Using a hierarchy to visualize data

## Quickstart
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ make frontend
```

`frontend.py` uses streamlit to graph different the different timeseries

## Updates to the Repository

I removed any unnecessary files that were used for tests. I switched from vega to streamlit, so the Javascript portion of the repo has been removed

Any file in `hierarchical-encapsulation` has been moved to the root folder in the repository

The file `top100k.csv` contains the first 100k rows in the 30 million+ rat dataset
